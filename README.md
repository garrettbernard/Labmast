Software I originally started writing because I thought there was a need for a digital replacement for 
science lab manuals and notebooks. Initial code was written while also conducting potential consumer 
feedback. After several hundred collegiate lab instructors were contacted and chatted with me about 
the software idea, it became obvious that there wasn't a need (they simply didn't want to move away 
from the book versions).

Code that exists works alright. Some modules don't have any functionality.

Most of this was written in 2012-13.
