		<p>Labmast strives to be an upgrade from the paper-bound laboratory manuals of the past. By bringing lab manuals into the cloud, Labmast 
		provides additional functionality to help organize student laboratory assignments and provide an improved learning environment. Labmast achieves this by 
		providing more background information and allowing for real-time data manipulation to help lab instructors quickly address student needs and help students better 
		understand laboratory and scientific concepts.</p>
		<p>The goal of Labmast is to improve educational science laboratories and promote better understanding in the classroom within a paperless (or nearly-paperless) 
		environment, helping students in any laboratory setting. At the core, Labmast is the modern lab manual built for today's modern, always-connected world.</p>
